    // Connectors will enable communication between the client and the
    // gateway. They can be customized to add an additional layer between
    // the client and the gateway in order to add more features (user management,
    // limits, analytics, etc).
    // For instance, to add user management, you would create a connector that
    // would communicate with a service you own, which in turn would talk to the
    // stream gateway to create an actual streaming session.
    // The connector would pass that session information to the SDK which takes
    // care of the rest.
